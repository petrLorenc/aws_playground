🧠 I am starting something OLD ...

I’m a passionate reader 📚 . In the past, I even tried sharing my book reviews on my old personal blog (in Czech): https://lnkd.in/gFyEJs2p. Later, I moved to Goodreads: https://lnkd.in/gPxS_gVm. Now, I’m thinking that sharing some noteworthy books here on LinkedIn—especially with a technical focus to keep it professional and not just “another” social network—might motivate others to read something beyond blog posts.
My reasoning why it can be beneficial is simple: if someone invests the time to write and publish a book, it usually means they have something more long-lasting to say 💎 . Blog posts, on the other hand, often cover topics that feel outdated tomorrow (with few exceptions if they don’t). The real challenge, of course, is finding time to read ⏲️ . For me, commuting on public transport works best. Audiobooks might also be an option for you—though, while I enjoy technical podcasts, listening to a technical book as an audiobook is another level. Still, it’s better than nothing in most cases.

My first book recommendation:
Hands-On Large Language Models - https://lnkd.in/g6Abxi4s

This book is very popular because the authors have been publishing on this topic for a while, and their blogposts were one of the first clear explanations of the Transformer architecture. However, that’s also its main drawback: if you’ve already read their blog posts, you might not gain as much as you expect—it’s essentially a rearrangement of their online content. Another issue is the target audience:
If you’re new to the domain and just want to learn about LLMs, it might be too deep.
If you’re a programmer, you probably care more about software optimization (libraries, services, programming languages) than LLM internals—you likely treat models as a black box anyway (shoutout to few exceptions on the market).
If you’re a researcher, you probably know all this already.
That said, I haven’t found a better explanation of Transformers. If you dislike reading blog posts or prefer structured reading over scattered posts, this book is a good investment.
My rating:
7/10 for general audience (or developers) 😉 
5/10 for researchers 🥱 
Have you read this book? What’s your impression? Did it help you solve a practical problem? If so, how?

Final tips:
I used to prefer physical books, but since joining the Apple ecosystem, I’ve grown to love Apple Books. You can upload PDFs from any device, and they sync across all your devices. My usual flow: I find or buy something interesting on my laptop, then read it mostly on my iPad while commuting—or on my iPhone when I have just a few minutes and relaxing isn’t an option.
+ 
I got this book from Humble Bundle, where I bought many ML books for the price of one—so I recommend checking it occasionally for great deals.

PS:
I use LLM to fix the grammar but emoticons are mine 😇
